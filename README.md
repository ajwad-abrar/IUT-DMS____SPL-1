<p align = 'justify' >IUT DMS is basically a web based application for maintaining the dormitory system digitally. Every year many students get into IUT & start staying in the hall, get notified about hall notices, inform the authority about any problem and do other activities. We tried to build a system to put these activities in an automated way. </p>
