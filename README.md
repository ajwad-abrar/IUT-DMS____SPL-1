# IUT-DMS____SPL-1
A project for Software Project Lab - I. IUT DMS is basically a web based application for maintaining the dormitory system digitally. Every year many students get into IUT & start staying in the hall, 
get notified about hall notices, inform the authority about any problem and do other activities. It is a platform which is built to put these activities in an automated way.
